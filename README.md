Example:


From your university to your home, the rickshaw fare is 2 dollar 50  cents. Your university friend's house is in the neighborhood. The rickshaw fare from the university to his house is 1 dollar 80 cents. You negotiated a rickshaw with 3 dollars 20 cents which will first drop your friend at his house and then will take you to your destination.

> Now, how do you divide the fare between you two so that- no one will pay extra. We need the fairest split of the 3 dollars and 20 cents such that two individuals pay exactly for the service they get, and no individual gain or lose from the collaboration. 

The following screenshot shows the result depicted by a computer program.
